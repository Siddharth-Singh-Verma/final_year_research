        "## Abstract\n",
        "Resume-job matching is a critical task in recruitment, enabling organizations to efficiently identify candidates whose skills align with job requirements. This project explores the effectiveness of different approaches to resume-job matching, transitioning from **rule-based methods** to **machine learning (ML), deep learning, and generative AI**. By analyzing the performance of these techniques, we aim to determine the most efficient approach for improving automated hiring processes. The study begins with rule-based matching, progresses to ML algorithms, incorporates deep learning techniques, and finally investigates the potential of generative AI for enhancing job-resume matching accuracy.\n"
